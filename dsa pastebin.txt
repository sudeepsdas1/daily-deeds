First its important to understand the Data structures that we will require to solve a problem.
 
Course - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/dsa-self-paced
 
Bought the above course but did not complete it as I lacked consistency and dedication :(.
I would first go through the course and get burnt out halfway through it. Then goto any coding website thinking that learning is enough and now its time to start solving problems.\
I will not be able to solve the problem and soon come to the realization that learning the concept is important and go back to a course to study a topic. This went on and on.
 
So I decided to go topic by topic

Dynamic Programming - This one was hard to understand, so I took a while and read a lot of resources to understand it.

Backtracking

To practice problems I would choose a specific topic and solve the problems once I studied that data-structure/algorithm.

If you are stuck at a problem, do not hesitate to look for solutions. Make sure while reading the solution you understand the core concepts very well.
 
Remember, approach >>> solution
 
I gained a lot of knowledge from the open-source community and leetcode. I wanted to share my strategy so that I will can be of help to others. Hope this helps!
